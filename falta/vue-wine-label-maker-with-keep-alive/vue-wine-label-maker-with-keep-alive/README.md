# Vue Wine Label Maker with Keep-Alive

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/xiiberpage/pen/YzBXXYE](https://codepen.io/xiiberpage/pen/YzBXXYE).

A silly demo to show how to make a wine label maker in Vue.js. To make it work in codepen, I had to change up the templates, to see the actual configuration with imports, exports and .vue files, I have a github repo you can check out: https://github.com/sdras/vue-wine-label
