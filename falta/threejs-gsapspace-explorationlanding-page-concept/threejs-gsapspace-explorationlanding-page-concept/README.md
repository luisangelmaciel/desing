#  ThreeJS & GSAP - Space Exploration - Landing Page Concept

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Darkbbeider/pen/OJdbZxZ](https://codepen.io/Darkbbeider/pen/OJdbZxZ).

This landing page concept depicts a space theme that makes use of ThreeJS,  GSAP,  Bootstrap,  Lottie animation as well as fontawesome icon set and some custom fonts, in order to create a unique intro effect. I have also included a public GLTF asset available in the threejs github models repo and loaded that into the scene. The page is made to be fully responsive and the menu is interactive and dynamic, based on user viewport.
